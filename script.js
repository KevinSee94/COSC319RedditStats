My gaming relationship with my parents was pretty average or toned down. I can't remember my Mom ever really actively engaging in games. She'd at most play hella BigFish Games, point and click adventures, Bejeweled, and currently Candy Crush. I don't know or remember if she ever really played anything besides that. I know she bought DKC Returns with the idea of playing it with me on a Christmas one year, but that didn't happen. \\n\\nI think my dad always liked games from a graphical or progression standpoint. He'd play a few games he got with graphics cards or for free with some kind of whatever on PC. I remember him playing Far Cry and talking with me about that at some point. Something about having trouble at a part with mutant gorillas or something. I also remember him playing a version of SF2 on PC at some point. It was some blanka electric scrub shit. I also know he would help me out at times when I sucked at games early on. I remember him helping me out with a Zerg boss battle on Toy Story 2. I was also scared of failing in games for some reason or another for a while when I was younger.\\n\\nI mostly got into gaming thanks to watching my brother play PC games and stuff. I also watched my sister play a lot of Spyro since she was super into Spyro at the time. \\n\\nA story not involving me though, but including my parents. I think I still have a copy of I think Zork 2 or one of the early zorks that they played together before I was born.

We mostly don't know if a machine can have motives.

You never specified if it was all stamps currently in print, so why would it stop at all the stamps that are currently in print? It's going for all the stamps. All the stamps that ever are and can be. \\n\\nWell then it begins logging and using all modern infrastructure to make paper and stamps. Eventually it begins to replant and grow trees to continue making more stamps. Eventually it gets to the point that it knows the basic component of stamps are carbon. It eventually realizes that humans are carbon. \\n\\nIf you give a machine with infinite intelligence an objective like \\\"protect the humans on this underwater station\\\" you get the situation of SOMA, where an A.I. takes an objective and goes to the ultimate extreme with it. Notice that the two main characters aren't actually people, and thereby a possible threat to humans.
